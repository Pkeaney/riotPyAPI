This project is just a side learning project to understand how API calling works in Python using the requests module - In this case I am using the Riot Games API to call some sample Valorant data for the characters within the game.  I plan to make this more dynamic where you can select which header you want to search for e.g. Maps, Skins etc.
Currently I also have this data being outputted to a json file - this allows me to down the line perhaps use a language i'm familiar with (kdb+/q) to load this data into kdb tables etc. However, this could also be down entirely on Python.
